Test data leakage prevention in feature engineering

CRITICAL: These tests ensure features never use future information

Data leakage is the #1 risk in time-series ML. These tests verify:
1. Rolling features exclude current game
2. First games have NaN/0 (no history)
3. Features at time T only use data from times < T
4. Position z-scores use lagged values
5. Availability scores exclude current game
