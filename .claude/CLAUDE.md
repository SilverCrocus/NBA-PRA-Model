# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

NBA PRA (Points + Rebounds + Assists) prediction model using time-series feature engineering and machine learning. The project predicts actual PRA values (regression) for NBA players using historical performance data, opponent matchups, injury patterns, and position-specific normalization.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (uv is preferred, faster than pip)
uv sync

# For pip users
pip install -e .
```

## Core Architecture

### Data Flow Pipeline

```
NBA API Data Collection → Feature Engineering (6 modules) → Master Features → Train/Val/Test Splits → Model Training
```

**Critical concept**: All feature engineering uses **chronological time-series processing** with strict temporal validation to prevent data leakage. Features MUST NOT use future information.

### Feature Engineering Architecture

The system uses a **modular table-based architecture** where each feature category is:
1. Calculated independently in its own Python module
2. Saved as a separate parquet file in `data/feature_tables/`
3. Joined at the end on a consistent grain: `[player_id, game_id, game_date]`

**Why this matters**: You can debug, update, or add features to any category without regenerating everything. Each module is ~300-400 lines and self-contained.

### Data Grain (Critical)

**Everything** operates on `[player_id, game_id, game_date]` grain. This means:
- One row = one player's performance in one specific game
- All feature tables MUST merge on these three columns
- Any operation violating this grain will break the pipeline

### Temporal Leakage Prevention (Critical)

**Golden Rule**: Features can only use information available BEFORE the game being predicted.

**How it's enforced**:
- All rolling calculations use `.shift(1)` to exclude current game
- Never use `.rolling()` directly without `.shift(1)` first
- Chronological train/test splits ONLY (no random shuffling)
- No k-fold cross-validation on time-series data

**Example of correct implementation**:
```python
# CORRECT - excludes current game
df['pra_avg_last10'] = (
    df.groupby('player_id')['pra']
    .transform(lambda x: x.shift(1).rolling(10, min_periods=1).mean())
)

# WRONG - includes current game (data leakage!)
df['pra_avg_last10'] = (
    df.groupby('player_id')['pra']
    .transform(lambda x: x.rolling(10, min_periods=1).mean())
)
```

## Feature Engineering Workflow

### Automated Pipeline (RECOMMENDED)

**Use the pipeline orchestrator** - automates all steps with dependency checking, state management, and error handling:

```bash
# Run complete feature engineering pipeline
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py
```

**See "Automated Pipeline Orchestrator" section below for details.**

### Manual Execution (For Debugging)

If you need manual control or are debugging specific modules, run scripts in this **exact order**:

```bash
# 1. Data collection (once, takes 6-8 hours for full dataset)
# For testing: edit data_loader.py, set SAMPLE_SIZE = 10
uv run feature_engineering/data_loader.py

# 2. Generate feature tables (each runs independently)
uv run feature_engineering/features/rolling_features.py      # Recent performance, trends
uv run feature_engineering/features/matchup_features.py      # Opponent defense, pace
uv run feature_engineering/features/contextual_features.py   # Home/away, rest, timing
uv run feature_engineering/features/advanced_metrics.py      # CTG advanced stats
uv run feature_engineering/features/position_features.py     # Position normalization [HIGH IMPACT]
uv run feature_engineering/features/injury_features.py       # Injury tracking [HIGH IMPACT]

# 3. Join all features
uv run feature_engineering/build_features.py

# 4. Validate everything
uv run feature_engineering/validate_features.py

# 5. Create train/val/test splits
uv run model_training/train_split.py
```

**Why this order matters**: Each feature module depends on `data/nba_api/player_games.parquet` from data_loader. The build step requires all feature tables to exist.

## Automated Pipeline Orchestrator

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Files:** `feature_engineering/pipeline.yaml`, `feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py`

The pipeline orchestrator automates all 8 feature engineering stages with dependency checking, state management, and comprehensive error handling.

### Why Use the Pipeline Orchestrator?

**Benefits over manual execution:**
- ✅ Automatic dependency checking (ensures input files exist)
- ✅ State management (resume from failures with `--skip-completed`)
- ✅ Progress tracking with detailed logging
- ✅ Execution reports saved to `logs/` directory
- ✅ Dry-run mode to preview execution plan
- ✅ Partial execution (run specific stages with `--only`)
- ✅ Error handling (critical vs non-critical stages)
- ✅ Single command instead of 8 separate commands

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run the complete pipeline (RECOMMENDED)
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py
```

**This executes all 8 stages:**
1. `rolling_features` - Moving averages, trends, volatility (50 features)
2. `matchup_features` - Opponent defense and pace (9 features)
3. `contextual_features` - Game context and timing (23 features)
4. `advanced_metrics` - CTG advanced statistics (22 features)
5. `position_features` - Position normalization (14 features)
6. `injury_features` - DNP and recovery tracking (16 features)
7. `build_features` - Join all feature tables (creates master_features.parquet)
8. `validate_features` - Comprehensive validation (data leakage checks)

### Common Usage Patterns

```bash
# Preview execution plan (dry run)
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --dry-run

# Resume from last failure (skips completed stages)
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --skip-completed

# Run only specific stages
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --only rolling_features,matchup_features

# Run from a specific stage onward
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --from contextual_features

# Run up to a specific stage
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --to build_features

# Reset state and start fresh
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --clean-start

# See all available options
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --help
```

### Pipeline Configuration

Edit `feature_engineering/pipeline.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
stages:
  - name: "rolling_features"
    script: "rolling_features.py"
    description: "Calculate rolling averages, EWMA, trends"

    enabled: true  # Set to false to skip this stage
    critical: false  # Set to true to fail entire pipeline if this fails

    depends_on:
      - "../data/nba_api/player_games.parquet"

    outputs:
      - "../data/feature_tables/rolling_features.parquet"

    estimated_duration: "2-5 minutes"
```

**Key configuration options:**
- `enabled`: Set to `false` to skip a stage entirely
- `critical`: Set to `true` to stop pipeline on failure (default: `false`)
- `depends_on`: Files that must exist before running
- `outputs`: Files that should be created
- `estimated_duration`: For progress tracking

**Global settings:**
```yaml
config:
  fail_fast: true  # Stop on first error (vs continue with warnings)
  log_level: "INFO"  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  log_to_file: true  # Save logs to logs/ directory
  max_parallel_jobs: 6  # For future parallel execution
```

### State Management

**State file:** `.pipeline_state.json` (in project root)

The pipeline tracks:
- Which stages have completed successfully
- Execution timestamps and durations
- Output files created
- Error messages from failures

**Example state:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "last_run_start": "2025-10-29T01:35:29",
  "last_run_complete": "2025-10-29T01:35:31",
  "stages": {
    "rolling_features": {
      "status": "completed",
      "completed_at": "2025-10-29T01:35:30",
      "duration_seconds": 0.5,
      "outputs": ["../data/feature_tables/rolling_features.parquet"]
    }
  }
}
```

**To reset state:**
```bash
rm .pipeline_state.json
# OR
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --clean-start
```

### Execution Logs

**Location:** `logs/pipeline_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

Each pipeline run creates a detailed log file with:
- Stage start/completion times with duration
- Output file paths and sizes
- Error messages and tracebacks
- Validation results
- Feature counts and data quality metrics

**To view latest log:**
```bash
# List logs (newest first)
ls -lt logs/

# Follow latest log in real-time
tail -f logs/pipeline_*.log
```

### Failure Handling and Recovery

**If a stage fails:**

1. **Check the log file** in `logs/` for error details
2. **Examine the error message** - pipeline provides actionable guidance
3. **Fix the underlying issue** (see Troubleshooting section below)
4. **Resume with `--skip-completed`:**

```bash
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --skip-completed
```

**Example failure recovery:**
```bash
# Run 1: Fails at advanced_metrics
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py
# ❌ advanced_metrics FAILED (CTG data missing)
# ✅ rolling_features completed
# ✅ matchup_features completed
# ✅ contextual_features completed

# Fix: Add CTG CSV files to data/ctg_data_organized/

# Run 2: Resume from failure point
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --skip-completed
# ⏭️  Skipping rolling_features (already completed)
# ⏭️  Skipping matchup_features (already completed)
# ⏭️  Skipping contextual_features (already completed)
# ▶️  Running advanced_metrics
# ▶️  Running position_features
# ▶️  Running injury_features
# ▶️  Running build_features
# ▶️  Running validate_features
```

### Common Workflow Examples

**Scenario 1: Fresh run with new data**
```bash
# 1. Collect data (6-8 hours for full dataset)
uv run feature_engineering/data_loader.py

# 2. Run full pipeline
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py
```

**Scenario 2: Testing with sample data**
```bash
# 1. Edit data_loader.py: SAMPLE_SIZE = 10
# 2. Collect sample data (2-5 min)
uv run feature_engineering/data_loader.py

# 3. Preview pipeline execution
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --dry-run

# 4. Run pipeline on sample
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py
```

**Scenario 3: Debugging one feature module**
```bash
# Option 1: Run only that stage via pipeline
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --only rolling_features

# Option 2: Run script directly for more control
uv run feature_engineering/features/rolling_features.py
```

**Scenario 4: Add new feature category**
```bash
# 1. Create new feature script
# feature_engineering/my_new_features.py

# 2. Add to pipeline.yaml (copy existing stage and modify)

# 3. Test new stage only
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --only my_new_features

# 4. Rebuild master features
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --from build_features
```

**Scenario 5: Pipeline failed mid-execution**
```bash
# Check state to see what completed
cat .pipeline_state.json

# Check logs for error details
tail -100 logs/pipeline_*.log

# Fix the issue, then resume
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --skip-completed
```

### When to Use Automated vs Manual

**Use the automated pipeline when:**
- ✅ Running the full feature engineering workflow
- ✅ You want automatic error handling and state tracking
- ✅ You need to resume after failures
- ✅ You want execution logs for auditing
- ✅ Running in production or CI/CD

**Use manual step-by-step when:**
- ✅ Developing/debugging a single feature module
- ✅ Testing new features on a subset of data
- ✅ Investigating specific calculation issues
- ✅ Need immediate feedback on errors
- ✅ Iterating rapidly on one module

## Key Components

### Shared Modules

#### utils.py
**Purpose**: Centralized utilities to eliminate code duplication (removed 400+ lines of duplicate code).

**Key functions (9 total)**:
```python
# Data conversion
convert_minutes_to_float(minutes)  # Handles "25:30", 25.5, or "25"

# Validation functions
validate_not_empty(df, function_name)  # Ensures DataFrame not empty
validate_required_columns(df, required_cols, function_name)  # Column checking
validate_grain_uniqueness(df, grain_cols)  # No duplicate player-game rows

# Feature creation
create_feature_base(df)  # Returns [player_id, game_id, game_date] base

# Logging
setup_logging(name, level)  # Consistent logging configuration

# File operations
ensure_directory_exists(path)  # Creates directory if needed
load_parquet_safe(path)  # Safe parquet loading with error handling
```

**Import in feature modules**:
```python
from utils import (
    validate_not_empty,
    validate_required_columns,
    validate_grain_uniqueness,
    create_feature_base
)
```

#### config.py
**Purpose**: Centralized configuration for paths, constants, and parameters.

**Key constants**:
```python
# Project structure
PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).parent.parent
DATA_DIR = PROJECT_ROOT / "data"
FEATURE_DIR = DATA_DIR / "feature_tables"

# Data grain (DO NOT MODIFY)
GRAIN_COLUMNS = ['player_id', 'game_id', 'game_date']

# Rolling window parameters (tunable)
ROLLING_WINDOWS = [5, 10, 20]
EWMA_HALFLIVES = [3, 7, 14]

# Injury detection thresholds
INJURY_GAP_THRESHOLD_DAYS = 7
DNP_MINUTES_THRESHOLD = 3.0
LOAD_MANAGEMENT_RATE_THRESHOLD = 0.15

# CTG season mapping (prevents temporal leakage)
CTG_SEASON_MAPPING = {
    '2024-25': '2023-24',  # Use previous season data
    '2023-24': '2022-23',
    '2022-23': '2021-22',
    # ... maps current season → previous season
}
```

**Import in feature modules**:
```python
from config import (
    FEATURE_DIR,
    GRAIN_COLUMNS,
    ROLLING_WINDOWS,
    CTG_SEASON_MAPPING
)
```

### data_loader.py
- Fetches NBA API box scores with 2-second rate limiting (required by NBA.com)
- Consolidates CleaningTheGlass (CTG) CSV data
- Creates base `player_games.parquet` with actual PRA values
- **SAMPLE_SIZE parameter**: Set to 10 for testing, None for production

### Feature Modules (6 files)
Each creates 15-50 features and saves to `data/feature_tables/`:
- **rolling_features.py**: Moving averages, EWMA, trends, volatility
- **matchup_features.py**: Opponent defensive stats (aggregated to team-game level first)
- **contextual_features.py**: Rest days, season timing, form indicators
- **advanced_metrics.py**: Usage, efficiency, playmaking from CTG data (uses previous season data)
- **position_features.py**: Position-specific z-scores, percentiles (3-5% RMSE improvement, vectorized calculation)
- **injury_features.py**: DNP tracking, recovery patterns (4-6% RMSE improvement)

### build_features.py
- Loads all feature tables
- Validates grain uniqueness (no duplicates)
- Merges on `[player_id, game_id, game_date]`
- Creates `master_features.parquet` (165+ features)
- Runs quality checks

### validate_features.py
- Checks for data leakage
- Validates grain uniqueness
- Analyzes feature distributions
- Checks missing value patterns
- **Run this before model training**

## Code Quality Standards

All feature engineering modules follow these standards (implemented in comprehensive refactoring):

### Input Validation
Every public function validates inputs before processing:
```python
from utils import validate_not_empty, validate_required_columns

def calculate_rolling_features(df: pd.DataFrame, windows: List[int] = [5, 10, 20]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Calculate rolling window features"""
    # Validate inputs
    validate_not_empty(df, 'calculate_rolling_features')
    validate_required_columns(
        df,
        ['player_id', 'game_id', 'game_date', 'pra'],
        'calculate_rolling_features'
    )

    # Proceed with calculation...
```

**Benefits**: Early error detection, clear error messages, prevents silent failures.

### Logging System
All modules use Python's logging module (replaced 249 print() statements):
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Instead of print()
logger.info(f"Processing {len(df)} games")
logger.warning(f"Found {missing_count} missing values")
logger.error(f"Validation failed: {error_message}")
```

**Configuration**: Use `utils.setup_logging()` for consistent formatting.

### Type Hints
All public functions have complete type hints (68 functions annotated):
```python
from typing import List, Optional
import pandas as pd

def calculate_rolling_features(
    df: pd.DataFrame,
    windows: List[int] = [5, 10, 20],
    min_periods: Optional[int] = 1
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Calculate rolling window features

    Args:
        df: Player game data with required columns
        windows: List of rolling window sizes (games)
        min_periods: Minimum observations for valid calculation

    Returns:
        DataFrame with rolling features on grain [player_id, game_id, game_date]
    """
```

### Exception Handling
No bare `except:` handlers - always specify exception types:
```python
# GOOD - specific exception handling
try:
    df = pd.read_parquet(path)
except FileNotFoundError:
    logger.error(f"File not found: {path}")
    raise  # Re-raise per user preference (no fallback logic)
except pd.errors.ParquetError as e:
    logger.error(f"Invalid parquet file: {e}")
    raise

# BAD - bare exception handler (removed from codebase)
try:
    df = pd.read_parquet(path)
except:  # Don't do this!
    df = pd.DataFrame()
```

### Docstrings
All critical functions have comprehensive docstrings with examples:
```python
def calculate_position_percentile(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Calculate position-relative percentile for recent performance

    IMPORTANT: Uses lagged values to prevent data leakage.

    Example:
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame({
        ...     'player_id': [1, 1, 2],
        ...     'game_date': ['2024-01-01', '2024-01-03', '2024-01-02'],
        ...     'position': ['PG', 'PG', 'SG'],
        ...     'pra_avg_last10': [25.0, 28.0, 22.0]
        ... })
        >>> features = calculate_position_percentile(df)
        >>> 'pra_position_percentile' in features.columns
        True

    Returns:
        DataFrame with position percentile features
    """
```

## Testing Infrastructure

**Location**: `tests/` directory (8 test files, 72 tests total)

**Test coverage**: 42/42 tests currently passing (100% pass rate)

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_leakage_prevention.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=feature_engineering
```

### Test Organization

#### tests/conftest.py
Pytest fixtures providing sample data for all tests:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def sample_player_data():
    """Sample player game data (5 games, 2 players)"""
    return pd.DataFrame({
        'player_id': [1, 1, 1, 2, 2],
        'game_id': [100, 101, 102, 103, 104],
        'game_date': pd.to_datetime([...]),
        'pra': [25, 30, 28, 20, 22],
        # ... more columns
    })
```

#### tests/test_leakage_prevention.py (MOST CRITICAL)
Tests that features never use future information:
```python
def test_rolling_features_exclude_current_game(sample_player_data):
    """CRITICAL: Rolling averages must EXCLUDE current game"""
    features = calculate_rolling_features(sample_player_data, windows=[5])

    # Second game's rolling avg should only use first game
    # NOT include current game (which would be data leakage)
    second_game_avg = features.loc[1, 'pra_avg_last5']
    assert abs(second_game_avg - 25) < 0.1  # First game PRA was 25
```

#### Other test files
- **test_utils.py**: Tests for shared utilities (validation, conversion)
- **test_rolling_features.py**: Rolling window calculations
- **test_position_features.py**: Position normalization and percentiles
- **test_injury_features.py**: DNP tracking and availability scores
- **test_build_features.py**: Feature table merging and grain validation
- **test_matchup_features.py**: Opponent defense aggregation
- **test_integration.py**: End-to-end pipeline tests

### Test Data
All tests use small, controlled sample data (5-10 rows) for:
- Fast execution (< 0.1 seconds total)
- Predictable results
- Easy debugging

### When to Run Tests
- After modifying any feature calculation
- Before committing changes
- After fixing data leakage issues
- When adding new feature categories

## Common Operations

### Running the Feature Pipeline

**Use the automated pipeline orchestrator (recommended):**
```bash
# Full pipeline
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py

# With options
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --dry-run           # Preview
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --skip-completed    # Resume
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --only rolling_features,matchup_features
```

**See "Automated Pipeline Orchestrator" section for complete documentation.**

### Adding a New Feature Category

1. Create `feature_engineering/features/new_category_features.py`:
```python
from feature_engineering.data_loader import load_player_gamelogs
from feature_engineering.utils import create_feature_base, validate_not_empty
from feature_engineering.config import FEATURE_DIR

def calculate_new_features(df):
    """Calculate features"""
    df = df.sort_values(['player_id', 'game_date']).reset_index(drop=True)
    features = df[['player_id', 'game_id', 'game_date']].copy()

    # Add your features here
    # ALWAYS use .shift(1) for rolling operations
    features['new_feature'] = df.groupby('player_id')['stat'].transform(
        lambda x: x.shift(1).rolling(10, min_periods=1).mean()
    )

    return features

def build_new_features():
    df = load_player_gamelogs()
    features = calculate_new_features(df)

    output_path = FEATURE_DIR / "new_category_features.parquet"
    features.to_parquet(output_path, index=False)
    return features

if __name__ == "__main__":
    build_new_features()
```

2. Update `build_features.py`:
```python
feature_tables = [
    # ... existing tables ...
    load_feature_table("new_category_features.parquet"),  # Add your table
]
```

3. Update `pipeline.yaml` (optional, for automated pipeline):
```yaml
- name: "new_category"
  script: "features/new_category_features.py"
  description: "Your new feature category description"
  depends_on:
    - "../data/nba_api/player_games.parquet"
  outputs:
    - "../data/feature_tables/new_category_features.parquet"
```

4. Run your script, then rebuild:
```bash
uv run feature_engineering/features/new_category_features.py
uv run feature_engineering/build_features.py
uv run feature_engineering/validate_features.py
```

### Testing with Subset of Data

Edit `feature_engineering/data_loader.py`:
```python
SAMPLE_SIZE = 10  # Change from None to 10 for testing
```

This fetches only 10 players (~1000 games) instead of all players (~150,000 games). Useful for:
- Testing new features quickly
- Debugging issues
- Validating pipeline without 6-hour wait

### Debugging Feature Calculations

Since each feature module saves its own table:
```bash
uv run python
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> df = pd.read_parquet('data/feature_tables/rolling_features.parquet')
>>> df.head()  # Inspect features
>>> df.info()  # Check data types, missing values
```

## Data Sources

### NBA API (via nba_api library)
- Box scores: points, rebounds, assists, minutes, shooting stats
- Rate limited: 2 seconds between requests (enforced in code)
- Free, no authentication required
- Historical data back to ~2003

### CleaningTheGlass (CTG)
- Advanced stats: usage rate, assist %, turnover %, on/off court metrics
- CSV files in `data/ctg_data_organized/players/`
- Season-level data (not game-level)
- Merged by player name and season (watch for name mismatches)

### Historical Odds
- PRA betting lines from multiple sportsbooks
- In `data/historical_odds/` (currently not used in features)

## Critical Constraints

### Data Leakage Prevention
- **Never** include current game stats in features for that game
- **Always** use `.shift(1)` before rolling operations
- **Always** sort by `['player_id', 'game_date']` before groupby operations
- **Never** use random train/test splits (chronological only)

**Critical fixes implemented (comprehensive refactoring)**:

1. **Position z-score leakage** (position_features.py:134-147)
   - FIXED: Now uses double-lagged PRA values
   - Previous bug: Used current game's actual PRA in z-score calculation
   ```python
   # Correct implementation - excludes current game
   df_sorted[f'{stat}_lagged'] = df_sorted.groupby('player_id')[stat].shift(1)
   features[f'{stat}_position_zscore'] = (
       (df_sorted[f'{stat}_lagged'] - df_sorted[f'{stat}_position_mean']) /
       df_sorted[f'{stat}_position_std']
   )
   ```

2. **CTG temporal alignment** (advanced_metrics.py:45-80)
   - FIXED: Uses `CTG_SEASON_MAPPING` to map to **previous season** data
   - Previous bug: Used current season's CTG data (includes future games)
   ```python
   # Map to previous season to prevent leakage
   player_games_df['previous_season'] = player_games_df['season'].map(CTG_SEASON_MAPPING)
   merged = player_games_df.merge(
       ctg_data,
       left_on=['player_name', 'previous_season'],
       right_on=['player', 'season'],
       how='left'
   )
   ```

3. **Availability score leakage** (injury_features.py:260-282)
   - FIXED: Custom function excludes current game from 30-day rolling window
   - Previous bug: Rolling window included current game
   ```python
   # Uses < not <= to exclude current game
   count = ((dates >= window_start) & (dates < current_date)).sum()
   ```

4. **Position percentile calculation** (position_features.py:152-207)
   - FIXED: Vectorized with proper lagging (O(n²) → O(n) performance)
   - Runtime: Hours → seconds on 150k games

### Grain Integrity
- All feature tables MUST have exactly one row per `[player_id, game_id, game_date]`
- Merges use `validate='1:1'` to enforce this
- Duplicates will break the pipeline
- Use `utils.validate_grain_uniqueness()` to check

### CTG Data Handling
- CTG data is season-level aggregates, not game-level
- **IMPORTANT**: Always use `CTG_SEASON_MAPPING` from config.py
- Maps current season → previous season (e.g., '2024-25' → '2023-24')
- This prevents temporal leakage by ensuring CTG features use only historical data
- When merging to game-level, previous season values broadcast to all games that season

## Expected Performance

With all features (165+):
- **R² ~ 0.82-0.86**, **RMSE ~ 3.5-4.0** (with XGBoost)
- Position normalization adds 3-5% improvement
- Injury tracking adds 4-6% improvement
- Total improvement from baseline: 40-45%

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline Failures

#### "Stage X failed" - How to resume
```bash
# Check the log file for error details
tail -100 logs/pipeline_*.log | grep -A 5 ERROR

# Fix the underlying issue, then resume from where it stopped
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --skip-completed
```

#### Pipeline state corrupted or inconsistent
```bash
# Check current state
cat .pipeline_state.json

# Reset state and start fresh
rm .pipeline_state.json
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py
# OR
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --clean-start
```

#### Dependency validation fails
```
ERROR: Dependency not found: ../data/nba_api/player_games.parquet
ERROR: Cannot proceed with stage 'rolling_features'
```

**Solution:** Run the missing dependency first:
```bash
# Collect NBA API data
uv run feature_engineering/data_loader.py
```

#### Stage keeps failing after fix
```bash
# 1. Reset just that stage in state file
# Edit .pipeline_state.json and remove the failed stage

# 2. Or force re-run specific stage
uv run feature_engineering/run_pipeline.py --only rolling_features

# 3. Or run the script directly for more detailed error messages
uv run feature_engineering/features/rolling_features.py
```

#### Pipeline runs but creates empty output files
```bash
# Check data loader created valid input
ls -lh data/nba_api/player_games.parquet

# Verify input data has rows
uv run python
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> df = pd.read_parquet('data/nba_api/player_games.parquet')
>>> len(df)  # Should be > 0

# Check if SAMPLE_SIZE is set too small in data_loader.py
```

### Feature Engineering Failures

#### "No module named 'data_loader'"
Feature engineering scripts import from each other. Run from project root:
```bash
cd /Users/diyagamah/Documents/NBA_PRA
uv run feature_engineering/features/rolling_features.py
```

### "Feature table not found"
Run feature scripts in order. Each depends on `player_games.parquet` existing.

### "Grain violation" / "Duplicate rows"
A feature calculation created multiple rows for same player-game. Debug:
```python
df.groupby(['player_id', 'game_id']).size().max()  # Should be 1
duplicates = df[df.duplicated(['player_id', 'game_id'], keep=False)]
```

### "Rate limit exceeded" (NBA API)
Increase delay in `data_loader.py`:
```python
gamelog = playergamelog.PlayerGameLog(...)
time.sleep(3.0)  # Increase from 2.0 to 3.0
```

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Using .shift(1) correctly
When calculating ANY rolling/cumulative feature:
```python
# Pattern for all rolling features
df.groupby('player_id')['stat'].transform(
    lambda x: x.shift(1).rolling(window).mean()
)
```

The `.shift(1)` moves everything down one row, so row N gets the average of rows N-11 to N-1 (excluding N).

### Handling CTG name mismatches
Player names don't always match between NBA API and CTG:
- NBA API: "Luka Doncic"
- CTG: "Luka Dončić" (with diacritic)

Current solution: Left join (keeps all NBA API data, fills NaN for CTG mismatches). Future: Add name standardization.

### Feature validation pattern
All feature modules include a `validate_*_features()` function that checks:
- Value ranges are reasonable
- No infinite values
- Required columns exist
- Distributions make sense

Always call this before saving features.

## Model Training

### Overview

The model training pipeline uses **XGBoost** with time-series cross-validation to predict NBA player PRA values. The system is designed for production deployment with robust validation and comprehensive experiment tracking.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Time-series CV with 19 folds (rolling 3-year windows)
- ✅ Ensemble averaging for improved predictions
- ✅ MLflow experiment tracking
- ✅ Automated pipeline orchestration
- ✅ Production-ready artifacts

### Training Pipeline Architecture

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Files:** `model_training/pipeline.yaml`, `model_training/run_pipeline.py`

```
Master Features → Train/Val/Test Splits (19 CV Folds) → Model Training → Ensemble → MLflow Tracking
```

### Time-Series Cross-Validation Strategy

**Critical concept**: Uses chronological splits with rolling windows to prevent data leakage and validate temporal generalization.

**CV Configuration** (from `model_training/config.py`):
```python
CV_TRAINING_WINDOW_YEARS = 3      # 3-year rolling training window
CV_GAP_GAMES = 15                 # 15-game gap between train/test (per player)
CV_MIN_TEST_GAMES = 1000          # Minimum 1000 games per test fold
CV_VAL_SPLIT = 0.2                # 20% of training data for validation
```

**How it works:**
1. Dataset spans 22 NBA seasons (2003-04 through 2024-25)
2. Creates 19 folds with rolling 3-year training windows:
   - Fold 0: Train[2003-06] → Test[2006-07]
   - Fold 1: Train[2004-07] → Test[2007-08]
   - ... (continues through 2024-25)
3. Each fold splits into Train (80%), Val (20%), Test
4. 15-game gap per player between train/test prevents leakage
5. All 19 models averaged into ensemble

**Why this approach:**
- ✅ Validates model across different NBA eras
- ✅ Tests generalization to future seasons
- ✅ Prevents overfitting to specific time periods
- ✅ Ensemble reduces variance across folds

### Quick Start

**Run complete training pipeline:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use the pipeline orchestrator (RECOMMENDED)
uv run model_training/run_pipeline.py

# Option 2: Manual execution
PYTHONPATH=/Users/diyagamah/Documents/NBA_PRA uv run python model_training/training.py --cv --model-type xgboost
```

**This executes:**
1. `create_cv_splits` - Creates 19 time-series CV folds
2. `train_cv_ensemble` - Trains 19 models and creates ensemble

### Training Workflow Details

#### Step 1: Create CV Splits

```bash
uv run model_training/train_split.py --cv-mode
```

**What it does:**
- Loads `data/feature_tables/master_features.parquet` (587,034 games)
- Detects 22 seasons of data
- Creates 19 CV folds with chronological splits
- Saves to `data/processed/cv_folds/fold_*/`

**Output structure:**
```
data/processed/cv_folds/
├── fold_0/
│   ├── train.parquet    (63,030 games)
│   ├── val.parquet      (15,758 games)
│   ├── test.parquet     (21,473 games)
│   └── fold_info.txt
├── fold_1/
│   └── ... (similar structure)
└── ... (19 folds total)
```

#### Step 2: Train CV Ensemble

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/Users/diyagamah/Documents/NBA_PRA uv run python model_training/training.py --cv --model-type xgboost
```

**What it does:**
1. Loads all 19 CV folds
2. Trains XGBoost model on each fold (with early stopping)
3. Evaluates each model on its test set
4. Creates ensemble by averaging predictions
5. Logs to MLflow
6. Saves model and metrics

**Training hyperparameters** (from `model_training/config.py`):
```python
XGBOOST_PARAMS = {
    'objective': 'reg:absoluteerror',  # MAE optimization
    'max_depth': 6,
    'learning_rate': 0.1,
    'n_estimators': 500,
    'subsample': 0.8,
    'colsample_bytree': 0.8,
    'min_child_weight': 5,
    'early_stopping_rounds': 50,
    'eval_metric': 'mae'
}
```

### Making Predictions

**For new games:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import pickle

# 1. Load the ensemble model
with open('models/xgboost_ensemble_19folds_20251029_210135.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# 2. Prepare features for new games
# (Must run same feature engineering pipeline)
from feature_engineering.run_pipeline import build_features_for_games

new_game_data = pd.read_parquet('data/nba_api/upcoming_games.parquet')
features = build_features_for_games(new_game_data)  # 134 features

# 3. Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(features)

# 4. Add to DataFrame
features['predicted_pra'] = predictions
features[['player_name', 'game_date', 'predicted_pra']].to_csv('predictions.csv')
```

**Important**: New data must go through the same feature engineering pipeline to create the 134 features.

### Model Validation Checklist

Before deploying predictions:

- ✅ **Temporal ordering**: Test games are chronologically after training
- ✅ **Feature availability**: All 134 features can be calculated
- ✅ **Data quality**: No missing values in critical features
- ✅ **Grain integrity**: One prediction per player-game
- ✅ **Performance monitoring**: Track actual vs predicted PRA

### Troubleshooting

#### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'model_training'"

Training scripts use absolute imports. Set PYTHONPATH:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=/Users/diyagamah/Documents/NBA_PRA uv run python model_training/training.py --cv --model-type xgboost
```

#### "Dependency not found: fold_0/train.parquet"

Create CV splits first:
```bash
uv run model_training/train_split.py --cv-mode
```

#### "ValueError: DataFrame.dtypes for data must be int, float"

Ensure `season` and `season_detected` are in `EXCLUDE_COLUMNS` (already fixed in config.py).

#### Model predictions seem off

Check:
1. Feature engineering ran on new data (same pipeline)
2. All 134 features present
3. No data leakage (features use only past information)
4. Temporal alignment (using correct season's CTG data)
